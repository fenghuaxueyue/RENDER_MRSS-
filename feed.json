Because the Yes Men are being sued for this stunt, p2p is the only way that this film will get seen. Please spread the word!\n\n<h2>From the Yes Men<\/h2>\n<p>\"We have been impersonating people in power in order to make political points for over a decade. The Yes Men Fix the World is our second feature film. It's won a bucket of awards and accolades, but we're still broke. We are hoping that people who share it will donate some money so that we can do even more outrageous actions.<\/p>\n\n<p>How outrageous? Outrageous enough to get us sued! Not long ago The US Chamber of Commerce took us to court for impersonating them. That is why on this special p2p version of the Yes Men Fix the World, we have included an exclusive video that the US Chamber of Commerce does not want you to see. You can only see this surprising film on the exclusive VODO p2p release.<\/p>\n\n<p>One final note: making films takes lots of hard work. And money. We busted our asses to make this film and still owe our friends barrels of cash they loaned us. By supporting us and joining the Yes Men Labs, you not only get a membership card and an entry into the prize draw, you also help us to pay all those people back and fund future projects. We're sharing by P2P because we made this film to be watched, and with your help we'll able to carry on with what we love doing.\" <\/p>\n\n<h2>About the Yes Men<\/h2>\n<p>The Yes Men are Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno, a culture jamming activist-duo raising awareness around social problems caused by corporations. Operating under the mission statement of telling the truth and exposing lies, they practice a concept they call \"identity correction\", in which they impersonate entities that they dislike -- some would call it social engineering on a grand scale! From their offices in Milwaukee, they create and maintain fake websites similar to ones they intend to spoof, which have successfully lead to numerous interview, conference, and TV talk show invitations. These occasions are then used to expose, through parody and surreal humour, the dark motivations of our multinational world.<\/p>"},"size":{"0":"732904952.0"},"duration":{"0":"5739.0"},"video_codec":{"0":"Xvid"},"framerate":{"0":"29.97"},"video_bitrate":{"0":"898.0"},"width":{"0":"640"},"height":{"0":"352"},"pixel_aspect_ratio":{"0":"1.82"},"audio_codec":{"0":"mp3"},"samplerate":{"0":"44100.0"},"channels":{"0":"2"},"audio_bitrate":{"0":"114.0"}}},{"entry":{"title":{"0":"Everything Unspoken"},"detailLink":{"0":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/evun"},"torrentLink":{"0":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/assets\/torrents\/Everything.Unspoken.2004.Xvid-VODO.torrent"},"published":{"0":"2010-06-08-12:29:53 PM"},"id":{"0":"2adcb9486252bac4f9d450fc3e5111867ef00a66"},"rights":{"0":"Attribution - Noncommercial - No Derivative Works"},"name":{"0":"Anthony Ferraro"},"content":{"@attributes":{"type":"html"},"0":"Everything Unspoken follows a couple as they\nstruggle to face up to their own\u2014and each other\u2019s\u2014limitations and aspirations.

Her business and home, and a few of the other area taverns and restaurants, are the last of the \u201cold time\u201d holdouts.\nThe idea of interviewing a psychic interested me early on in this project, as I pass several on my walking route each day. I worked up the nerve to buzz the psychic on the 2nd floor of one building in particular, and was immediately buzzed up. There I met Lilah who was very, very reluctant to be interviewed. I was quickly informed that 1-2 times each month she is asked for interviews by students, newspapers and magazines \u2013 and she turns them all down. I took my time, didn\u2019t push, and enjoyed a 30-minute conversation about nothing much at all. I showed her the piece I did on Pat, whom she knows. At the end, she agreed to see me the next day but wouldn\u2019t allow me to film her face. I reluctantly agreed. I suppose I could always film her hands?\nThe next afternoon, I showed up at the appointed time, and we discussed my approach and how I thought the interview could best reflect her story. After 15 minutes of visiting and some gentle persuasion, she agreed to let me film her \u2013 face and all. We chatted for a little over an hour, and the final piece is my impression of that time, boiled down to 5 minutes.

We wanted to test ourselves to see if we could make a movie for nothing, so we worked around the mantra; \"if you don't have money, you can't spend money.\" If there's zero budget, there's zero risk for damage. *** One of the key to successfully making this movie was, we had not 1, but 3 plan B's! \"If this doesn't work, we do this. If this person doesn't turn up, we use this guy\" kind of thing. The process was almost mechanical, with little or no space for experimentation. The results however, felt organic, because to a certain extent, it was ALL experiment. The main focus was to FINISH THE SHOOT. *** We literally did everything ourselves. Juliane was director, production manager, AD, secondary camera operator, SFX make-up artist, editor and graphic designer. Adrian was lead actor, DP, primary camera operator, sound supervisor, gaffer, driver, sound designer and music composer and score supervisor (for the 2 additional composers). However, credits were also given out deservingly as we had many dedicated helpers on set, and they made us look more heroic than it sounds. Consisting mainly of students and film buffs, we are proud to say that by the end of the \"Emperor\" shoot, they had graduated into a bona fide film crew. *** We are now in the process of finding our audience in the new era of social networking: Youtube and Facebook, to generate interest in the movie and ourselves as filmmakers. *** It is our sincere hope that you will help us on this journey.
